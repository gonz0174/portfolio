Challenges and process


Learnings building my portfolio

I've learned a lot in the Web Development course over the last two semesters. Being an international student with another native language is certainly challenging, especially since I had never seen anything about coding, HTML, CSS, or Bootstrap before. However, I have discovered that when you pay attention in class and then practise it on your own in these "Assignments," you see that everything is possible, your designs are possible, and your knowledge grows because you are often required to investigate your own. This last point makes you feel fulfilled because you learn just as much from your college professors as you do on your own.

Bootstrap was required for this final Assignment, which is something completely different from what you have been seeing since the first semester, but in my opinion, it is much better because it is more responsive in images and the grid, among other things.

It was satisfying for me to create my website, which would eventually become the online store for my brand.
