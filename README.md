MY OWN BUSINESS STORE / PORTFOLIO

Challenges and process

I began this project with low Fidelity, that is, I designed wireframes for my online store called Farfett (my future brand) that could look good. Once the design was complete, I began to add images, fonts, and colours to give an identity to what was later created as a prototype of what it could look like to be high Fidelity, which confirmed that this was how the web page should be seen.

For this Final Assignment, we were instructed to code using Bootstrap, which was initially a challenge for me because I knew that with certain classes, I could modify the code without using a lot of CSS, making it the ideal option because you simplify and save time. On the other hand, I envisioned it as a puzzle in which you would go to the Bootstrap Library, find what you wanted to do or implement, and copy the code to later adapt to what you wanted to do. I liked Bootstrap because I noticed that everything was more responsive, from the images to the grid, and so on.


Learnings building my portfolio

I've learned a lot in the Web Development course over the last two semesters. Being an international student with another native language is certainly challenging, especially since I had never seen anything about coding, HTML, CSS, or Bootstrap before. However, I have discovered that when you pay attention in class and then practise it on your own in these "Assignments," you see that everything is possible, your designs are possible, and your knowledge grows because you are often required to investigate your own. This last point makes you feel fulfilled because you learn just as much from your college professors as you do on your own.

Bootstrap was required for this final Assignment, which is something completely different from what you have been seeing since the first semester, but in my opinion, it is much better because it is more responsive in images and the grid, among other things.

It was satisfying for me to create my website, which would eventually become the online store for my brand.
